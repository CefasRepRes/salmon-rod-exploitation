Participation rates declined with population density and gross domestic product, indicating a negative effect of urbanisation and post-modernisation on fishing interest. Participation rates also declined with increasing median age, average household size and unemployment rate, suggesting resource limitation to constrain participation in fishing. By contrast, two indicators of the cultural importance of fish (fish landings and per capita fish consumption) and an indicator of perceived need for leisure (weekly working hours) were positively correlated with fishing participation. Based on these findings, which explained 60\% of the variance in fishing participation across the industrialised world, reduced fishing interest is to be expected with post-industrialisation. Dedicated management and marketing intervention is needed to reverse the track of diminishing fishing interest in industrialised countries.},

  abstract = {An integral part of population monitoring within fisheries is ground-based surveys of fish redds. Remotely piloted vehicles or drones (RPVs) could provide a complementary method but need verification due to a host of methodological differences. To compare methods, we counted summer Chinook redds (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) ( 6 m2 in size) using RPVs and compared them to ground-based counts in the Wenatchee River (WA, USA). We found individual aerial counts were many times twice the corresponding ground counts. We also found large inter-observer variability among aerial counters. The coefficient of variation among multiple aerial counts were 37\%, 38\%, and 50\% across three sites, which are comparable to published variation in ground counts. We attribute inter-observer variability to inherent uncertainties in redd identification similar to ground counting, and importantly, we did not see evidence that the clarity of substrate in the image influenced observer bias. Overall, our data suggest that redd counting using RPVs is an effective method, particularly in high-density spawning locations. We conclude that RPV imagery accurately identifies redds in a clear, relatively wide (60 m) river, but suggest continuing research into increasing precision, limiting observer variability, and assessing the accuracy across methods and locations.},

Prior probability distributions are useful for transferring knowledge from data-rich to data-poor fisheries. When data are limited, it is important to make the most of what few data is available. However, fully understanding potential biases in data are just as important in the data-poor context as it is in data-rich fisheries. A key aspect of stock assessment is peer review. Providing a comprehensive, yet concise, set of diagnostics is crucial to a stock assessment where time is limited. Against the standards by which data-rich stock assessments are judged, stock assessments for data-poor stocks are likely to be found deficient. A key challenge is to maintain a balance between the opposing risks of inappropriate management 'action' due to assessment inaccuracy, and inappropriate management 'inaction' due to assessment uncertainty.},

Since the early 1980s, the ICES Working Group on North Atlantic Salmon has collated and interpreted catch data, exchanged information on research initiatives, and provided advice to managers in support of conservation efforts for Atlantic salmon. During the past three decades, the annual production of anadromous Atlantic salmon from more than 2000 rivers draining into the North Atlantic has been less than 10 million adult-sized salmon. This represents a minor component, by number and biomass, of the pelagic ecosystem in the North Atlantic Ocean. Ideally, Atlantic salmon would be assessed and managed based on river-specific stock units, the scale that best corresponds to the spawner to recruitment dynamic. In reality, comparatively few river-specific assessments are available for either the Northwest or the Northeast Atlantic. The marine survival of Atlantic salmon is low and, based on return rates of smolts to adults from monitored rivers, has declined since the mid- to late 1980s. Abundance has declined more severely for the multi-sea-winter components, and especially in the southern areas of the species' range. Common patterns in abundance, inferred at the level of stock complex in the North Atlantic, suggest that broad-scale factors are affecting productivity and abundance and that they are acting throughout the salmon's time at sea.},

  abstract = {Summary Abstract: This chapter contains sections titled: In 1998, after several years of effort on the part of the Government of Canada, the provinces and the Atlantic Salmon Federation (ASF), the commercial fishery for wild Atlantic salmon effectively ended in Canada. Steps to end the fishery began in 1966 and proceeded through closures, retirement of licenses, and compensation programmes involving hundreds of commercial salmon fishermen in Quebec and the Atlantic provinces. This occurred at immense political and financial cost [\$72 million (Canadian)]. In New England, the last elements of the commercial salmon fishery were terminated in 1948 following a catch of 47 salmon. In 1993-94 ASF and the North Atlantic Salmon Fund (NASF) negotiated a two-year compensated conservation agreement with commercial salmon fishermen in Greenland. Following this, the salmon fishery re-emerged, although in a reduced state due to limitations resulting from the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization (NASCO) treaty. A subsistence fishery was permitted to allow for local needs. More recently, however, the commercial salmon fishery in Greenland has resumed harvest of salmon from North American and European waters. In Labrador, a marine harvest of salmon has also re-emerged through the resident food fishery that intercepts salmon bound for rivers in the Atlantic provinces, Quebec and the USA. Another interceptory fishery in St. Pierre presents risks for salmon in Newfoundland rivers. All of these fisheries threaten the success of restoration of salmon populations in North America to their former abundance. This paper reviews the several measures that were adopted in North American waters to terminate the commercial salmon fishery and the results of these measures. It outlines the many challenges faced by government regulators and non-government organizations in achieving termination of the commercial salmon fishery.},

An alternate model proposes that both North American and European stocks migrate in the North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre (NASpG) where S. salar enter the NASpG on their respective sides of the Atlantic, and travel counterclockwise within the NASpG until returning to natal rivers. A review of data accumulated during the last 50 years suggests a gyre model is most probable. Freshwater parr metamorphose into smolts which have morphological, physiological and behavioural adaptations of epipelagic, marine fishes. Former high-seas fisheries were seasonally sequential and moved in the direction of NASpG currents, and catches were highest along the main axis of the NASpG. Marking and discrimination studies indicate mixed continental origin feeding aggregations on both sides of the Atlantic. Marked North American smolts were captured off Norway, the Faroe Islands, east and west Greenland, and adults tagged at the Faroes were recovered in Canadian rivers. Marked European smolts were recovered off Newfoundland and Labrador, west and east Greenland, and adults tagged in the Labrador Sea were captured in European rivers. High Caesium-137 (137Cs) levels in S. salar returning to a Quebec river suggested 62.3\% had fed at or east of Iceland, whereas levels in 1 sea-winter (SW) Atlantic Canada returnees indicated 24.7\% had fed east of the Faroes. Lower levels of 137Cs in returning 1SW Irish fish suggest much of their growth occurred in the western Atlantic. These data suggest marine migration of S. salar follows a gyre model and is similar to other open-ocean migrations of epipelagic fishes.},

  abstract = {Proportional data, in which response variables are expressed as percentages or fractions of a whole, are analysed in many subfields of ecology and evolution. The scale-independence of proportions makes them appropriate to analyse many biological phenomena, but statistical analyses are not straightforward, since proportions can only take values from zero to one and their variance is usually not constant across the range of the predictor. Transformations to overcome these problems are often applied, but can lead to biased estimates and difficulties in interpretation. In this paper, we provide an overview of the different types of proportional data and discuss the different analysis strategies available. In particular, we review and discuss the use of promising, but little used, techniques for analysing continuous (also called non-count-based or non-binomial) proportions (e.g. percent cover, fraction time spent on an activity): beta and Dirichlet regression, and some of their most important extensions. A major distinction can be made between proportions arising from counts and those arising from continuous measurements. For proportions consisting of two categories, count-based data are best analysed using well-developed techniques such as logistic regression, while continuous proportions can be analysed with beta regression models. In the case of {$>$}2 categories, multinomial logistic regression or Dirichlet regression can be applied. Both beta and Dirichlet regression techniques model proportions at their original scale, which makes statistical inference more straightforward and produce less biased estimates relative to transformation-based solutions. Extensions to beta regression, such as models for variable dispersion, zero-one augmented data and mixed effects designs have been developed and are reviewed and applied to case studies. Finally, we briefly discuss some issues regarding model fitting, inference, and reporting that are particularly relevant to beta and Dirichlet regression. Beta regression and Dirichlet regression overcome some problems inherent in applying classic statistical approaches to proportional data. To facilitate the adoption of these techniques by practitioners in ecology and evolution, we present detailed, annotated demonstration scripts covering all variations of beta and Dirichlet regression discussed in the article, implemented in the freely available language for statistical computing, r.},

  abstract = {Migration is an important ecological trait that allows animals to exploit resources in different habitats, obtaining extra energy for growth and reproduction. The phenology (or timing) of migration is a highly heritable trait, but is also controlled by environmental factors. Numerous studies have reported the advancement of species life-events with climate change, but the rate and significance of such advancement is likely to be species specific, spatially variable and dependent on interactions with population and ecosystem changes. This is particularly true for diadromous fishes which are sentinels of change in both freshwater and marine domains, and are subject to considerable multiple stressors including overfishing and habitat degradation. Here, we describe trends in the migration phenology of three native Irish migratory fishes over half a century, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), brown trout (Salmo trutta) and European eel (Anguilla anguilla). The trends were derived from daily counts of 745,263 fish moving upstream and downstream through the fish traps of the Burrishoole catchment, an internationally important monitoring infrastructure allowing a full census of migrating fish. We found that the start of the seaward migration of eel has advanced by one month since 1970. The commencement of the salmon smolt migration has advanced by one week, although the rest of the migration, and the entirety of the trout smolt run has remained stable. The beginning of the upstream migration of trout to freshwater has advanced by 20 days, while the end of the run is more than one month later than in the 1970's. The greatest phenological shift has been in the upstream migration of adult salmon, with at least half of migrating fish returning between one and two months earlier from the marine environment compared to the 1970's. The earlier return of these salmon is coincident with reduced marine survival and decreasing body size, indicating considerable oceanic challenges for this species. Our results demonstrate that the impacts of climate change on the phenology of diadromous fish are context-dependent and may interact with other factors. The mobilization of long-term datasets are crucial to parse the ecological impacts of climate change from other anthropogenic stresses.},

This study developed Bayesian hierarchical mixed-effects models relating 0+ Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) and trout (Salmo trutta L.) densities to different aspects of river discharge. Associations between these densities and nine hydrological variables representing the magnitude, frequency and duration of discharge events were evaluated using historical monitoring data from 36 sites on five rivers in England and Wales. All hydrological variables had weak associations with 0+ salmonid densities. More frequent high discharges between spawning and emergence were positively and negatively associated with 0+ salmon and trout densities, respectively. High discharges might increase spawning site availability for salmon and decrease egg-to-fry survival for trout. However, overall, only equivocal evidence was found regarding which discharge aspects affect juvenile salmonid densities. Therefore, a strategic review of juvenile salmonid monitoring programmes integrating environmental data collection is recommended.},

Occupancy and N-mixture abundance models, which correct for imperfect detection, are commonly used for this purpose. Fitting these models in a Bayesian framework has advantages but doing so can be challenging and time-consuming for many researchers. We developed an R package, ubms, which provides an easy-to-use, formula-based interface for fitting occupancy, N-mixture abundance and other models in a Bayesian framework using Stan. The package also provides tools for visualizing parameter effects, calculating residuals, assessing goodness-of-fit and comparing models. We demonstrate the use of ubms by fitting an N-mixture model to ruffed grouse Bonasa umbellus count data from drumming surveys conducted at roadside points sampled on five occasions annually during 2013?2015. To demonstrate the functionality of ubms, we used survey site as a random effect, and occasion date and per cent aspen cover at each site as covariates of detection and abundance respectively. The top-ranked model included a positive effect of per cent aspen on grouse abundance. ubms has the potential to greatly increase the range of users who will be able to rigorously assess species distribution and abundance while correcting for imperfect detection in a Bayesian framework.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Recreational fishing, by both local residents and tourists, is a popular activity globally. The behaviour and motivation of recreational fishers is different from those of commercial fishers. Unlike the latter, the former are not dependent on making profits to continue fishing. Rather, the value of recreational fishing to those who engage in it is a combination of catches and experience values. The latter value implies that recreational fishers might continue fishing when they should not, analogous to the effect of subsidy in the commercial fishing sector. Hence, the term ``self-subsidizing'': a fishery as one in which fishers subsidize themselves through an economic investment in gear and time from their non-fishery-based earnings. The consequence of which is that recreational fishers can continue fishing long after the commercial fishing industry has stopped fishing because their operations have become economically unviable. There is reason to argue that in many areas, recreational fishing effort, due to the self-subsidizing mechanism, is sustained at a high rate while stocks decrease. In this contribution, we describe the innate self-subsidizing forces in recreational fishing and discuss their implications.},

We developed a hierarchical Bayesian modelling (HBM) approach that take full advantage of the diverse assemblage of data at hand to estimate homogeneous time series of abundances irrespective of the data collection procedure. We apply our approach to the estimation of adult abundances of 18 Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations of Brittany (France) from 1987 to 2017 using catch statistics, environmental covariates, and fishing effort. Additional data of total or partial abundance collected in four closely monitored populations are also integrated into the analysis. The HBM framework allows the transfer of information from the closely monitored populations to the others. Our results reveal no clear trend in the abundance of adult returns in Brittany over the period studied.},

  abstract = {Abstract Recreational fisheries are diverse in scale, scope, and participation worldwide, constituting an important ecosystem service of marine and freshwater ecosystems. Management of these socio-ecological systems is challenged by monitoring gaps, stemming from difficulties engaging with participants, biased sampling, and insufficient resources to conduct biological or social surveys of fish and human populations. In the Internet age, online data have great potential to make a meaningful contribution to recreational fisheries research, monitoring, and management. Recreational fishers in some countries increasingly use social and other digital media to share their experiences with followers, with most data freely available to web scrapers that compile databases of text (e.g. tweets, status updates, comments), photos, videos and other media that contain information about spatiotemporal activity, sentiments towards catches/experiences, targeted and bycatch species, effort levels, and more. Although the future of recreational fisheries research, monitoring and management will likely involve more digital scraping, uptake is only just beginning and there are several challenges including tool availability/accessibility, sampling biases, and making findings relevant and usable to practitioners. Despite these challenges, we envision fisheries managers will increasingly turn towards online sources of fisheries data to supplement conventional methods. We challenge scientists to work towards continued method development and validation of various digital fisheries data tools and emphasize how biases from the online behaviour of users may complicate interpretations of these data for fisheries management.},

  abstract = {Ireland has one of the last remaining commercial salmon driftnet fisheries in the North Atlantic, with recent catches averaging 162 000 salmon (1997-2003), approximately 20\% of the total landings of salmon in the entire North Atlantic. Since 2001, the Irish commercial salmon fishery has been managed on the basis of Total Allowable Catch (TAC) in each of 17 salmon fishing districts. This has been made possible by applying a number of new and innovative techniques to the estimation of conservation limits (CLs) and pre-fishery abundance (PFA) for combined stocks in each district. Stock and recruitment parameters from well-monitored European rivers were "transported" to all Irish rivers using a Bayesian hierarchical stock and recruitment (BHSRA) model. This provided the posterior probability distributions of the model parameters and related reference points, including individual river CLs. District PFA and the number of spawners were estimated for a baseline period of 1997-2003, using district catch data, estimates of unreported catch, and exploitation rate. Harvest guidelines were established on the basis of surplus of spawning fish over the CL for the baseline period. In line with scientific advice, the commercial fishery has been reduced from 212 000 fish in 2002 to 182 000 in 2003. In 2004, a total catch (including the rod catch) of approximately 160 000 wild salmon was advised.},

It outlines the major estimation approaches being applied, the methods for dealing with zero observations, how to identify and select appropriate explanatory variables, and how standardized catch rate data can be used when conducting stock assessments.},

  abstract = {Interpretation of data used in fisheries assessment and management requires knowledge of population (e.g. growth, natural mortality, and recruitment), fisheries (e.g. selectivity), and sampling processes. Without this knowledge, assumptions need to be made, either implicitly or explicitly based on the methods used. Incorrect assumptions can have a substantial impact on stock assessment results and management advice. Unfortunately, there is a lack of understanding of these processes for most, if not all, stocks and even for processes that have traditionally been assumed to be well understood (e.g. growth and selectivity). We use information content of typical fisheries data that is informative about absolute abundance to illustrate some of the main issues in fisheries stock assessment. We concentrate on information about absolute abundance from indices of relative abundance combined with catch, and age and length-composition data and how the information depends on knowledge of population, fishing, and sampling processes. We also illustrate two recently developed diagnostic methods that can be used to evaluate the absolute abundance information content of the data. Finally, we discuss some of the reasons for the slowness of progress in fisheries stock assessment.},

Data were available for 50 months from the years 1971 to 1981. The most important single determinant of catch was found to be fishing effort measured in boat-days. An additional 10 boat days were found to correspond to a catch of almost 6 salmon and 23 sea trout. The relationship between catch and stock was weaker, though a relatively high catchability of sea trout at low stock levels was recorded. Slock levels, fishing effort and environmental factors accounted for much, but not all, of the variation in catch from month to month and from year to year. Most of the effect of rainfall, sunshine and water level was attributable to variations in fishing effort associated with these factors.},

A consensus has emerged that standard rules on salmon flow needs for water management across all rivers are unattainable. However, this does not preclude an underlying conceptual framework that should guide a consistent scientific basis to flow management for protecting salmon. This article examines the potential for a conceptual framework from a British Isles perspective, assuming that upstream migration is an emergent property from selection to optimise lifetime fitness. The template for this adaptation is the diversity of river types and hydro-morphology in British rivers coupled with life-history and migration adaptations that may be influenced by flow-related factors. Models of adult salmon migration through estuaries and rivers are outlined that may provide a basis for developing generic guidance.},

  abstract = {Abstract A hierarchical Bayesian life cycle model is presented that considers spatial covariation of marine life history traits of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations in the North Atlantic. The model is based on a collective analysis of the dynamics of 13 stock units (SUs) from two continental stock groups (CSGs) in North America and Southern Europe in a single hierarchical model over the period 1971?2014. The model sets up a new assessment framework for Atlantic salmon stocks. It also provides a framework to investigate the drivers of changes in Atlantic salmon population dynamics including disentangling the effects of fisheries from those of environmental factors in a hierarchy of spatial scales. It is used to test the hypothesis of a strong spatial synchrony in marine life history dynamics of Atlantic salmon populations. The trends in two key parameters associated with the early marine phase of the life cycle are estimated: (i) the marine survival during the first summer?autumn spent at sea and (ii) the proportion of fish maturing after the first winter at sea. The results provide evidence of a decline in the marine survival together with an increase in the proportion of fish that mature after the first winter at sea, common to all SUs. Our results show an increased coherence in the covariations of trends in these two marine life history traits related to geographic proximity of SUs which support the hypothesis of a coherent response of geographically proximate Atlantic salmon populations that likely share similar migration routes.},

However, current large-scale maps show strong disparities, despite good validation statistics of their underlying models. Here, we attribute this contradiction to a flaw in the validation methods, which ignore spatial autocorrelation (SAC) in data, leading to overoptimistic assessment of model predictive power. To illustrate this issue, we reproduce the approach of large-scale mapping studies using a massive forest inventory dataset of 11.8 million trees in central Africa to train and validate a random forest model based on multispectral and environmental variables. A standard nonspatial validation method suggests that the model predicts more than half of the forest biomass variation, while spatial validation methods accounting for SAC reveal quasi-null predictive power. This study underscores how a common practice in big data mapping studies shows an apparent high predictive power, even when predictors have poor relationships with the ecological variable of interest, thus possibly leading to erroneous maps and interpretations.},

  abstract = {Most exploitation of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is restricted to "homewater fisheries", which operate close to or within the rivers of origin of the stocks, but two "distant-water fisheries" are permitted to operate off the west coast of Greenland and in the Norwegian Sea, and take salmon from a large number of rivers over a wide geographical area. Providing robust quantitative catch advice for these mixed-stock fisheries depends upon the ability to forecast stock abundance for about 2000 salmon river-stocks around the North Atlantic, more than 1500 of which are in Europe. A "run-reconstruction" model is presented for estimating the historic pre-fishery abundance (PFA) of salmon for countries or regions around the Northeast Atlantic, based upon catch data and estimates of non-reporting rates and exploitation rates. These estimates are then used to develop predictive models of PFA on the basis of estimates of the egg deposition, derived from the run-reconstruction model and various environmental data. Although the selected environmental indices correlated with the PFA of both southern and northern European stock complexes, the main statistical significance in the forecast models was provided by temporal trends in the PFA. Clearly, such a model is only tenable in the short term, and will be poor at predicting a major change in stock status. Alternative approaches, based upon juvenile production indices and including Bayesian techniques, are therefore being considered.},

The structure of the hierarchical SR model developed distinguishes two nested levels of randomness, within-river and between rivers. It is an extension of the classical Ricker model, where the parameters of the Ricker function are assumed to be different between rivers, but drawn from a common probability distribution conditionally on two covariates: river size and latitude. The output of ultimate interest is the posterior predictive distribution of the SR parameters and their associated BRP for a new river with no SR data.The flexible framework of the Bayesian hierarchical SR analysis is a step towards making the most comprehensive use of detailed stock monitoring programs for improving management advice. Posterior predictive inferences may be imprecise due to the relative paucity of information introduced in the analysis compared to the variability of the stochastic process modeled. Even in such cases, direct extrapolation of results from local data-rich stocks should be dismissed as it can lead to a major underestimation of our uncertainty about management parameters in sparse-data situations. The aggregation of several stocks under a regional complex improves the precision of the posterior predictive inferences. When several stocks are managed jointly, even imprecise knowledge about each component of the aggregate can be valuable. The introduction of covariates to explain between stock variations provides a significant gain in the precision of the posterior predictive inferences. Because we must be able to measure the covariates for all the stocks of interest, i.e. mostly sparse-data cases, the number of covariates which can be used in practice is limited. The definition of the assemblage of stocks which we model as exchangeable units, conditionally on the covariates, remains the most influential choice to be made when attempting to transfer information from data-rich to sparse-data situations.},

An approach is outlined for conducting stock assessments in which parameters are estimated for multiple stocks at the same time. Information from data-rich stock assessments, e.g. trends in fishing mortality, and values for parameters of selectivity functions are provided to data-poor assessments in the form of penalties on the estimated parameters, which leads to stock assessments for the most data-poor stocks being informed by those for the most data-rich stocks. The method is applied for example purposes to data for nine stocks in Australia's southern and eastern scalefish and shark fishery. The results of the application confirm that results for data-rich stocks are little impacted by being assessed in conjunction with data-poor stocks and that the results for data-poor stocks can be qualitatively different when information for data-rich stocks is taken into account.},

We assess the sensitivity of posterior inferences to (i) the choice of Ricker model parameterizations, with special regards to management-related ones, and (ii) prior parameter distributions. Closed forms for Ricker parameter posterior distributions exist given S/R data known without error. We use this property to develop a procedure based on the Rao\textendash Blackwell formula. This procedure achieves integration of measurement errors by averaging these closed forms over possible S/R data sets sampled from distributions derived from a stochastic model relating field data to the S and R variables. High-quality Bayesian estimates are obtained. The analysis of the influence of different parameterizations and of the priors is made easier. We illustrate our methodological approach by a case study of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). Posterior distributions for S and R are computed from a mark\textendash recapture stochastic model. Ignoring measurement errors underestimates parameter uncertainty and overestimates both stock productivity and density dependence. We warn against using management-related parameterizations because it makes the strong prior assumption of long-term sustainability of stocks. Posterior inferences are sensitive to the choice of prior. The use of informative priors as a remedy is discussed.},

  abstract = {The Bayesian state-space modelling framework allows us to derive inferences on stochastic stage-structured population dynamics models from multiple series of sequential observations with measurement or sampling errors. A state-space model works from the coupling of two models. The first one mimics the dynamics by conditional Markovian transitions between successive hidden states. The second model describes the observation process with random errors. Statistical inferences on states variables and parameters are easily performed via Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov chains (MCMC) methods. The flexibility of MCMC methods allows us to analyse a wide range of state-space models with non-linear relationships in the dynamic and observation equations, and non-Gaussian error structure just as well. The Bayesian paradigm is efficient for deriving quantitative diagnostics on a probability based rationale. We illustrate the value of this framework by fitting a stage-structured life cycle model for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) to a data set resulting from the survey of the population of the river Oir (Lower Normandy, France) between 1984 and 2001. The system dynamics includes non-linear regulation and has a probabilistic structure accommodating for both the environmental and the demographic stochasticity. The observation model consists in capture-mark-recapture experiments for the evaluation of the runs of downstream migrating juveniles (smolts) and upstream migrating spawners, and random sampling for demographic features. A full Bayesian treatment of the model is carried out by means of Gibbs sampling. Outputs of main interest consist in the joint posterior distribution of all the model parameters and state variables such as the smolt and spawner runs.},

  abstract = {Following advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas and North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization, Irish salmon stocks have been managed on a river-by-river basis since 2007 with biological reference points (BRPs) based on maximum sustainable yield (MSY). A method for estimating BRPs at the river scale and the associated variability arising from observed variability in population structures and fecundities is presented here. Calculations of BRPs (referred to as conservation limits, CLs) were updated and their natural variability was included. Angling logbooks provided new river-specific weight data to give sea age and fecundity ranges, and improved estimates of river-wetted areas, to account for available nursery habitat for juveniles and river-specific carrying capacities, were introduced. To transport BRPs, Bayesian stock\textendash recruitment analysis was re-run with an updated list of monitored rivers and smolt ages. Results were converted to salmon numbers per river in Monte Carlo simulations incorporating the variability in sea ages and fecundities. Minimum sample size rules were implemented to reduce sampling error effects. Results showed that average total CL increased by 7\%, average one sea-winter (1SW) CL decreased by 5\% and average multi-sea-winter (MSW) CL increased by 157\%. Differences were attributed to increases in wetted areas, MSW proportions, and changes in both 1SW and MSW fecundities. While some changes were large, we believe that these updated CLs provide more accurate estimates and with associated confidence limits they are more robust, river-specific, and readily incorporated into stock assessments. As a significant improvement on their predecessors, they represent a major development for the conservation and management of salmon stocks. Additionally, the approach described is portable across stocks and has the potential to be implemented in other jurisdictions to improve the management of Atlantic salmon. Finally, this method of incorporating variation has application for the development of BRPs and management of other species.},

  abstract = {International wild Atlantic salmon management priorities have moved from exploitation to conservation since the 1990s, recognizing the need to protect diversity and abundance at individual river levels amid widespread declines. Here we review international salmon-stock assessments and describe a simple, transferable catch-advice framework, established for management of fisheries that conforms to international obligations. The risk assessment approach, applied at the river scale, jointly incorporates uncertainty in estimated and forecasted returning salmon numbers with the level of uncertainty around spawning requirements (Conservation Limits). Outputs include quantification of risk of stocks not attaining conservation limits (CL) and surpluses above CL on stocks able to support sustainable exploitation via total allowable catches (TAC), with monitoring by rod catch or fish counter. Since management implementation and cessation of at-sea mixed-stock fisheries, there has been a deterioration in the performance of many individual stocks, without any sustained increase in fisheries open to harvest. Given declines in mid-latitude Atlantic salmon populations over 30 years, the novel framework presented provides an approach to protect stocks failing to meet spawning thresholds while supporting sustainable exploitation of those achieving them. On-going management policy of adopting scientific advice and allowing exploitation only on stocks exceeding CLs is central to the objective of protecting salmon stocks.},
