This is a github (gh) repository (repo) for the "salmon-rod-exploitation" project. The gh repo includes the manuscript text, plots and tables, and the analysis code. The data are not included for various reasons, and so the analysis cannot be reproduced with the repo "as is". Please [contact me](mailto:stephen.gregory@cefas.gov.uk) if you would like to reproduce the analysis and I will help out however I can.

## Future refinements

-   Remove reliance on XLSX table files - convert them to csv?

-   Consider remaking plots in more accessible formats - <https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/> and <https://rdrr.io/github/kang-yu/lazyu/man/ggplotColours.html>

-   Consider re-writing in faster language, e.g., Template Model Builder: see <https://github.com/jtufto/tmb-betabinomial/blob/master/model.R>

-   Production-ready package (portable executable) - <https://github.com/dmenne/brmspack>

## Future extensions

-   Move to state-space to allow for better accounting for high release probabilities

-   Estimate exploitation rates for different sea-age components (e.g., 1SW and MSW) separately

-   Consider whether a beta-binomal mixture model might better account for large differences in catches between rivers
